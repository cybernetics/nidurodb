# Nidurodb

Nidurodb is a [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) interface for DuroDBMS, a relational database library.

Nidurodb exploits Nim's metadata facilities to provide database access using a relational algebra instead of SQL.

For example, the following SQL statement:

```
select a as x, b as y
from t
where a > 1000;
```

is equivalent to the following code in Nidurodb:

```
V(t).where(V(a) > 1000){a, b}.rename(a as x, b as y)
```

Loading the result into a sequence:

```
var
  s: seq[tuple[x: int, y: int]]
load(s, V(t).where(V(a) $> 1000){a, b}.rename(a as x, b as y), tx)
```

DuroDBMS is based on the principles laid down in the book *Databases, Types, and the Relational Model: The Third Manifesto* by C. J. Date and Hugh Darwen.

## Getting Started

To use Nidurodb, you need to download an install DuroDBMS ([Github](https://github.com/rehartmann/durodbms)|[Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/duro/files/duro/1.4/)).

Add the lib directory to the library path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux).

To create databases and tables and to run the tests you will also the the interpreter *Duro D/T*. To make the interpreter available on the command line, add the bin directory to the search path.

## Running the tests

After adding the DuroDBMS lib directory to the library path and the DuroDBMS bin directory to the system path, go to the test directory and type:

```
nim -p:../src c -r update.nim
nim -p:../src c -r ra.nim
```
